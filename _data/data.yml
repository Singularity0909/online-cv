    title: About me
    summary: |
      My name is Fu Tongyou. Currently I am a third-year computer science undergrad at Shandong University.

      From my point of view, computer science is a field where scientific research and engineering are closely combined, and among which, what I love the most is software engineering.

      As one who has passion for programming, my career ambition is to create high-quality applications to help with development of the information age. Besides, I hope to maintain a steady work-life balance.

      To achieve this goal, my current plan is to get some experience in software development thorough the internship.

        The International Collegiate Programming Contest is an extra-curricular, competitive programming sport for students at universities around the world, which provides gifted students opportunities to interact, demonstrate, and improve their teamwork, programming, and problem-solving process.

        I have been woring on it since the first year at college by learning data structures and algorithms and keeping exercises on online-judges almost every day. Recently My teammates and I are preparing for ICPC Asia Regional in the next spring.

      I have to admit that I lack experience in engineering, and that is why I am eager to get an intership.

      Some of the following projects are my individual projects, while others are for my on-campus courses.

    title: Skills &amp; Proficiency
    intro: >
      As a fan of algorithm competition, I solved over one thousand problems on online-judges by C++. So it is easy for me to do structured programming using C and C++ STL. Recently I start to read C++ Primer in order to have a better command of C++ OOP.

      As is mentioned above, I once built a Web App using a full stack framework. In this process I got an understanding of MVC design pattern and O/R Mapping.

      Furthermore, I carried out a lot of practice on data crawlers, UI design and many other areas out of interest. There were many times when I lost myself in those technologies and forgot about the time. Every time I spend time on them I feel much happy and contented indeed. I think that is my biggest advantage.
