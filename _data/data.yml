    title: About me
    summary: |
      I am Tongyou Fu. Currently I am a fourth-year computer science undergrad at Shandong University.

      From my point of view, computer science is a field where scientific research and engineering are closely combined, and among which, what I love the most is software engineering.

      As one who has passion for programming, my career ambition is to create more high-quality applications to help with development of the information age.

      To achieve this goal, my current plan is to get some experience in software development through the internship and to pursue a master's degree in CS or SE in England starting from Fall 2022.
